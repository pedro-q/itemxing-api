# Itemxing API
A REST API written in Rust, its main purpose is to save the Animal Crossing user's inventory generated by the [Animal Client](https://github.com/pedro-q/animalclient) but I guess it could have other purposes (maybe as a boilerplate Rust API?)

# Features
  - User and inventory structs
  - It uses [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/)!
  - Dotenv
  - Redis as DB for maximum speed and data loss
  - Google authentication

### Installation

You'll need a Redis instance to run this, so far I've tested it with the Windows Redis 3.0 port and Linux Redis 3.0 but I guess any Redis instance works.

Create an ```.env``` file and add your GGL_KEY

Run your
```
cargo run
```

And you're good to go ...
